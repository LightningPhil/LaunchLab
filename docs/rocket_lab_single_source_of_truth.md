# Rocket Lab Web App
## Mechanics + Propellant Reference + Future Data Schema

This document describes the shipped mechanics and the planned propellant-data upgrade for the browser-based “Rocket Lab” sandbox. Runtime truth lives in `src/rocket_physics.ts`, `src/rocket_propellants.ts`, `src/environment.ts`, and `src/flight.ts`. The CEA grid sections remain a future data design rather than a claim about the current placeholder chemistry.
**Aesthetics are explicitly out of scope.**

---

## 0) Scope and guiding choices

### What we simulate
- **2D point-mass rocket** with surface coordinates \((x,y)\), world-space position/velocity for integration, and mass \(m(t)\).
- **Thrust** acts along a direction \(\hat{\mathbf{t}}(t)\) determined by launch angle or a simple guidance rule.
- **Spherical inverse-square gravity** on a non-rotating world, with \(\mu=g_{surface}R^2\).
- **No aerodynamic forces**: no drag, no lift, no winds. (We still keep ambient pressure \(p_a\) as a nozzle-performance knob for teaching.)
- A smooth reference sphere, prescribed attitude, and perfectly inelastic surface contact. Terrain, staging, structural sizing, and engine/tank mass scaling are not simulated.

### What we compute from propellant + nozzle
The shipped teaching model computes \(c^*\), \(C_F\), and \(I_{sp}\) from constant per-pair gas properties, ideal isentropic nozzle equations, a vacuum-Isp calibration point, and a conservative Summerfield separation approximation. Mixture ratio changes tank bookkeeping only. Sections 8–11 describe the recommended future CEA-grid replacement.

### Canonical decomposition (engine performance)
\[
\dot m = \frac{p_c A_t}{c^*},\qquad
F = C_F\,p_c A_t,\qquad
I_{sp} = \frac{F}{\dot m g_0}=\frac{C_F c^*}{g_0}
\]

This decomposition is the app’s “physics spine”. Everything else plugs into it.

---

## 1) User-facing parameter set

### Environment
- Gravity \(g\) (m/s²)
- Ambient pressure \(p_a\) (Pa)
  - For “vacuum nozzle performance”, set \(p_a=0\).
  - For “sea-level nozzle performance”, set \(p_a=101325\ \mathrm{Pa}\).

### Vehicle
- Dry mass \(m_{dry}\) (kg)
- Propellant mass \(m_{prop,0}\) (kg)
- Initial position \((x_0, y_0)\), with \(y_0=0\)
- Initial velocity \((v_{x0}, v_{y0})\) (usually 0)
- Launch angle \(\theta_0\) (deg or rad; pick one unit in UI and convert internally)

### Guidance / steering (thrust direction)
- Mode A: **Fixed angle** \(\theta(t)=\theta_0\)
- Mode B: **Pitch program** ramp \(\theta(t)\) from \(\theta_0\) to \(\theta_f\)
- Mode C: **Prograde lock** (“toy autopilot”) once speed exceeds \(v_{min}\)

### Engine / nozzle
- Propellant combo (from a predefined set; see Section 2)
- Mixture ratio \(MR = O/F\) (oxidizer-to-fuel **by mass**)
- Chamber pressure \(p_c\) (Pa)
- Expansion ratio \(\varepsilon = A_e/A_t\)
- Throat area \(A_t\) (m²) **or** throat diameter \(d_t\)
- Efficiencies (optional but very useful)
  - Combustion efficiency \(\eta_c\) (scales \(c^*\))
  - Nozzle efficiency \(\eta_n\) (scales \(C_F\))
- Throttle (optional)
  - Throttle fraction \(\tau(t)\in[0,1]\) (default 1)

### Burn termination
- “Burn until propellant exhausted” (default)
- or “Fixed burn time” \(t_{burn}\)

---

## 2) Propellant reference set (fuel/oxidizer info + bounds)

This section defines the **initial propellant library** and the **default slider bounds**. Your runtime truth should come from CEA-derived grids.

> Note on naming:
> - **LOX** = liquid oxygen  
> - **LH2** = liquid hydrogen  
> - **CH4** = methane  
> - **RP‑1** = rocket-grade kerosene  
> - **N2O4** = dinitrogen tetroxide  
> - **MMH** = monomethylhydrazine  
> - **UDMH** = unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine  
> - **Aerozine‑50** = 50/50 hydrazine + UDMH (storable hypergolic blend)  
> - **H2O2** = hydrogen peroxide (concentration matters)  
> - **IRFNA** = inhibited red fuming nitric acid (storable oxidizer)

### 2.1 Cryogenic oxygen + fuels
#### LOX/LH2
- **Traits**: Highest chemical Isp class; low density LH2; cryogenic storage and insulation.
- **Typical MR behavior**: Many engines run **oxidizer-richer than peak-Isp** for cooling/cycle reasons.
- **Default MR bounds**: **4.5 → 6.5**
- **Notes to show in UI**: “Very high Isp, low density fuel, large tanks; good vacuum performance.”

#### LOX/CH4
- **Traits**: Cryogenic but denser than LH2; clean combustion; good compromise.
- **Default MR bounds**: **3.0 → 4.0**
- **UI note**: “Mid-high Isp; denser than LH2; good for reusability/cleaner operation.”

#### LOX/RP‑1 (kerosene)
- **Traits**: Dense and practical; strong sea-level booster propellant; lower vacuum Isp than CH4/LH2.
- **Default MR bounds**: **2.2 → 2.9**
- **UI note**: “Great liftoff thrust for given tank size; lower Isp than CH4/LH2.”

### 2.2 Storables / hypergolics
#### N2O4/MMH
- **Traits**: Storable; hypergolic ignition; common for spacecraft and restartable engines.
- **Default MR bounds**: **1.8 → 2.3**
- **UI note**: “Lower Isp than cryogenics; excellent storability and ignition reliability.”

#### N2O4/UDMH
- **Traits**: Storable; hypergolic; historically common.
- **Default MR bounds**: **1.4 → 1.9**

#### N2O4/Aerozine‑50
- **Traits**: Storable hypergolic blend; historic usage for temperature handling/storage robustness.
- **Default MR bounds**: **1.6 → 2.1**

### 2.3 “Other educational” propellants
#### H2O2/RP‑1 (High-test peroxide + kerosene)
- **Traits**: Lower Isp than LOX systems; oxidizer concentration (e.g., 85–98%) affects performance strongly.
- **Default MR bounds**: **6 → 8** (teaching range; refine after grid generation)
- **UI note**: “Interesting ‘simpler oxidizer’ trade; performance depends on concentration.”

#### IRFNA/RP‑1
- **Traits**: Storable oxidizer pairing; lower performance; unpleasant handling; historically important.
- **Default MR bounds**: **4 → 6** (broad teaching range)

### 2.4 “Performance anchors” (sanity checks, not the model)
Use published tabulated performance (e.g., from standard rocket propulsion texts) as **sanity checks** and for “expected class” hints, but **do not** use them as the runtime engine model. The runtime model comes from the precomputed CEA grid (Section 8–11).

---

## 3) Propulsion model (canonical runtime equations)

### 3.1 Effective characteristic velocity
\[
c^*_{eff}=\eta_c\,c^*(MR,p_c)
\]

### 3.2 Mass flow (choked throat)
\[
\dot m = \frac{p_c A_t}{c^*_{eff}}
\]

### 3.3 Effective thrust coefficient
\[
C_{F,eff}=\eta_n\,C_F(MR,p_c,\varepsilon,p_a,\text{eq/frozen})
\]

### 3.4 Thrust
\[
F = C_{F,eff}\,p_c A_t
\]

### 3.5 Isp and exhaust velocity
\[
I_{sp} = \frac{F}{\dot m g_0},\qquad v_e = g_0 I_{sp}
\]

### 3.6 Total impulse
Two equivalent computations:
1) Integrate thrust:
\[
I_{tot} = \int_0^{t_{end}} F(t)\,dt
\]
2) Integrate mass flow and Isp:
\[
I_{tot}=g_0 \int_0^{t_{end}} I_{sp}(t)\,\dot m(t)\,dt
\]

### 3.7 Propellant depletion + mass
\[
\frac{dm_{prop}}{dt}=-\dot m,\qquad m(t)=m_{dry}+m_{prop}(t)
\]

### 3.8 Mixture bookkeeping (tank gauges)
Given \(MR=O/F\):
\[
\dot m_O=\frac{MR}{1+MR}\dot m,\qquad
\dot m_F=\frac{1}{1+MR}\dot m
\]

---

## 4) Flight dynamics (spherical world, no drag)

### 4.1 Local and world frames
The UI angle \(\theta\) is measured from the local tangent. At world position
\(\mathbf r\), define radial unit vector \(\hat{\mathbf r}\) and forward tangent
\(\hat{\mathbf t}\). The commanded thrust direction is:
\[
\hat{\mathbf d}=\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf t}+\sin\theta\,\hat{\mathbf r}
\]

Surface \(x\) is unwrapped arc length; \(y=|\mathbf r|-R\) is altitude.

### 4.2 Forces and gravity
\[
\mathbf{F_T}=F\hat{\mathbf d},\qquad
\mathbf a_g=-\frac{\mu}{|\mathbf r|^3}\mathbf r,\qquad
\mu=g_{surface}R^2
\]
\[
\mathbf a=\frac{\mathbf{F_T}}{m}+\mathbf a_g
\]

Planets are intentionally spherical and non-rotating. No surface-rotation
velocity, Coriolis term, drag, lift, or wind is added.

### 4.3 Powered-segment integration
The canonical step is \(\Delta t=1/120\ \mathrm{s}\). Fuel depletion and
pitch-program boundaries split a step exactly. For constant mass flow and
midpoint thrust direction within one segment, the solver integrates:
\[
\Delta v_T=\frac{F}{\dot m}\ln\left(\frac{m_0}{m_1}\right)
\]
and uses the corresponding analytical variable-mass displacement. Gravity is
integrated with start/end acceleration in a velocity-Verlet-style update.
Ambient pressure and guidance are evaluated at a segment midpoint.

Sparse replay samples are never treated as a new physical model:
`sampleFlight()` re-runs these canonical steps from the preceding recorded
state to the requested inspection time.

### 4.4 Ground contact, apex, and cutoff
The surface is \(|\mathbf r|=R\). A descending crossing is bisected inside the
step, preserving incoming impact velocity before the terminal state is stopped.
Radial-velocity zero crossings are similarly refined for apex events. Burnout
is an exact segment boundary; a powered collision is not mislabeled burnout.

---

## 5) Guidance modes (mechanics)

### Mode A: Fixed angle
\[
\theta(t)=\theta_0
\]

### Mode B: Pitch program (linear ramp)
Ramp \(\theta\) from \(\theta_0\) to \(\theta_f\) between \(t_1\) and \(t_2\):
\[
\theta(t)=\theta_0+(\theta_f-\theta_0)\,\mathrm{clamp}\!\left(\frac{t-t_1}{t_2-t_1},0,1\right)
\]

### Mode C: Prograde lock (toy)
After \(\|\mathbf{v}\|>v_{min}\):
\[
\hat{\mathbf{t}}=\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}
\]
Fallback to fixed \(\theta\) if \(\|\mathbf{v}\|\) is near zero.

---

## 6) Rocket equation module (Δv intuition)

Include the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation as a comparator (ideal, no gravity loss):

\[
\Delta v = v_e\ln\left(\frac{m_0}{m_f}\right)
\quad\text{where}\quad
v_e=g_0 I_{sp}
\]
\[
m_0=m_{dry}+m_{prop,0},\qquad m_f=m_{dry}
\]

The pre-launch value uses initial nozzle conditions. During flight the app also
accumulates scalar ideal thrust delta-v segment by segment as pressure changes.
Display that value alongside burnout speed \(\|\mathbf{v}(t_{cutoff})\|\).
Their difference is **not** a pure gravity-loss measurement: gravity, changing
thrust direction, radial geometry, and initial velocity can all contribute.

---

## 7) Engine operating modes (user experience without breaking physics)

### Mode 1: User sets \(p_c\) and \(A_t\)
Compute:
\[
\dot m = \frac{p_c A_t}{c^*_{eff}},\qquad F = C_{F,eff}p_c A_t
\]
Burn time (if constant):
\[
t_{burn}=\frac{m_{prop,0}}{\dot m}
\]

### Mode 2: User sets thrust target \(F_{target}\)
Solve for throat area:
\[
A_t = \frac{F_{target}}{C_{F,eff}p_c}
\]
Then compute \(\dot m\), burn time.

### Mode 3: Throttle
Simplest consistent throttle: scale chamber pressure:
\[
p_c(t)=\tau(t)\,p_{c,nom}
\]
Recompute \(\dot m(t)\) and \(F(t)\) each step using the same canonical equations.

---

## 8) CEA-derived performance tables: runtime strategy

### 8.1 Why precompute
NASA CEA is a strong reference for equilibrium chemistry and rocket performance output. Running it in-browser is not desirable; instead:
- Generate grids offline (CEA or RocketCEA wrapper).
- Package as compact JSON (or binary) files.
- Interpolate at runtime.

### 8.2 What the grid must provide
At minimum, per grid point:
- \(c^*\) (m/s)
- \(C_F\) (dimensionless) **or** \(I_{sp}\) (s)

Recommended additional (optional) values for UI/teaching:
- chamber temperature \(T_c\) (K)
- exit pressure ratio \(p_e/p_c\)
- effective \(\gamma\) / molecular weight
- flags for likely overexpansion regime (heuristic only)

### 8.3 Equilibrium vs frozen
Store both datasets (two “expansion models”). Allow toggle:
- Equilibrium expansion tends to be slightly more optimistic early in expansion; frozen can be more realistic for fast expansions.

---

## 9) Concrete grid plan (per propellant)

Design goal: stable interpolation without artifacts near optimum MR, and reasonable file sizes.

### 9.1 Common axes
Use consistent axes across propellants where possible.

#### Chamber pressure axis \(p_c\) (bar)
Default set:
- **10, 20, 40, 70, 100, 150, 200, 300 bar** (8 points)

#### Expansion ratio axis \(\varepsilon=A_e/A_t\)
Default set:
- **5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 100, 150, 200** (8 points)

#### Ambient pressure axis \(p_a\)
At minimum:
- **0 Pa**, **101325 Pa** (2 points)

#### Expansion model
- **equilibrium**, **frozen** (2 datasets)

### 9.2 Mixture-ratio axis \(MR\) per propellant
Recommended sampling (denser where performance is steep vs MR):

- **LOX/LH2**: MR 4.0 → 7.0, **41 points**
- **LOX/CH4**: MR 2.8 → 4.3, **31 points**
- **LOX/RP‑1**: MR 2.0 → 3.2, **31 points**
- **N2O4/MMH**: MR 1.6 → 2.6, **25 points**
- **N2O4/UDMH**: MR 1.2 → 2.1, **25 points**
- **N2O4/AZ‑50**: MR 1.3 → 2.3, **25 points**
- **H2O2/RP‑1**: MR 5.0 → 9.0, **25 points**  
  *(treat peroxide concentration as separate propellant IDs)*
- **IRFNA/RP‑1**: MR 3.0 → 7.0, **25 points**

**File size sanity:**  
Example dataset (31×8×8×2 points) storing float32 cStar and Cf → ~31 kB of raw float data (+ JSON overhead). Very manageable.

### 9.3 Clamping + warnings
At runtime:
- Clamp user inputs to grid bounds.
- Warn when clamped (e.g., “Pc clamped to 300 bar; outside dataset”).

---

## 10) JSON schema for performance tables (runtime-friendly)

This schema supports:
- fast fetch
- compact storage
- simple interpolation

### 10.1 File layout
One file per propellant per expansion model containing both ambient pressures:
- `LOX_LH2_equilibrium.json`
- `LOX_LH2_frozen.json`
- etc.

### 10.2 Canonical JSON structure
```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "propellant_id": "LOX_LH2",
  "propellant_name": "LOX/LH2",
  "expansion_model": "equilibrium",

    },

    "date_utc": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "notes": "Any notes about propellant assumptions, e.g., H2O2 concentration."
  }
}
```

### 10.3 Canonical indexing order
Fix indexing so the last axis (MR) is contiguous:
- fastest: MR
- then Pc
- then eps
- then Pa

Linear index:
\[
i = (((i_{Pa}N_\varepsilon + i_{\varepsilon})N_{Pc} + i_{Pc})N_{MR} + i_{MR})
\]

---

## 11) Runtime interpolation (canonical)

Use trilinear interpolation in \((MR, Pc, eps)\), with optional linear interpolation in \(p_a\) between vacuum and 1 atm tables.

### Steps
1) Find bracket indices for each axis:
   - \(MR_{i0}\le MR \le MR_{i1}\)
   - \(Pc_{j0}\le Pc \le Pc_{j1}\)
   - \(\varepsilon_{k0}\le \varepsilon \le \varepsilon_{k1}\)
2) Normalized coordinates:
\[
u=\frac{MR-MR_{i0}}{MR_{i1}-MR_{i0}},\quad
v=\frac{Pc-Pc_{j0}}{Pc_{j1}-Pc_{j0}},\quad
w=\frac{\varepsilon-\varepsilon_{k0}}{\varepsilon_{k1}-\varepsilon_{k0}}
\]
3) Interpolate 8 corners for each field (cStar and Cf)
4) Ambient interpolation (optional teaching approximation):
\[
s=\mathrm{clamp}\left(\frac{p_a}{101325},0,1\right)
\]
\[
X(p_a)= (1-s)X_{vac} + sX_{1atm}
\]

---

## 12) Outputs (mechanics-only)

Real-time readouts / graphs:
- Thrust \(F(t)\)
- Mass flow \(\dot m(t)\)
- Specific impulse \(I_{sp}(t)\)
- Remaining propellant \(m_{prop}(t)\) + oxidizer/fuel split (if shown)
- Vehicle mass \(m(t)\)
- Liftoff thrust-to-weight:
\[
T/W = \frac{F(0)}{m_0 g}
\]
- Total impulse accumulator:
\[
I_{tot}\leftarrow I_{tot}+F\Delta t
\]
- Trajectory \(x(t), y(t)\), apogee, time-to-apogee, range
- Rocket equation \(\Delta v\) vs integrated burnout speed

---

## 13) Golden-path per-timestep update

For each canonical interval:

1) Split at fuel depletion or a pitch-program boundary.
2) Resolve local radial/tangent axes and midpoint guidance.
3) Evaluate ambient pressure and nozzle state. The throat must be choked;
   strongly over-expanded flow uses the Summerfield effective separation area.
4) Apply \(\eta_c\) and \(\eta_n\), then compute \(\dot m\), \(F\), \(I_{sp}\),
   impulse, and scalar ideal delta-v.
5) Integrate variable-mass thrust analytically and radial gravity with
   start/end acceleration.
6) Refine any apex or spherical-surface crossing inside the interval.
7) Mark fuel depletion as burnout. Mark an earlier powered surface crossing as
   impact, preserving the remaining propellant and incoming velocity.

UI, recording, prediction, replay inspection, and rendering consume this shared
solution without adding a second motion model.

---

## 14) Extension hooks (future, non-breaking)
- Add drag by introducing \(\mathbf{F_D}=-\tfrac12\rho C_D A \|\mathbf{v}\|\mathbf{v}\) (then atmosphere matters).
- Add staging (multiple \(m_{dry}\), \(m_{prop}\), engine sets).
- Replace illustrative propellant constants with versioned CEA interpolation grids.
- Couple chamber pressure, nozzle dimensions, tanks, and dry mass to a structural model.

---

## Appendix A: Propellant variants to treat as separate IDs
Some things should be separate propellant IDs rather than axes:
- H2O2 concentration (e.g., `H2O2_85`, `H2O2_90`, `H2O2_98`)
- RP‑1 vs generic kerosene approximations
- Different nitric acid formulations (IRFNA variants)

---

## Appendix B: Minimal in-app propellant registry JSON (metadata + bounds)
```json
{
  "propellants": [
    {
      "id": "LOX_LH2",
      "name": "LOX/LH2",
      "category": "cryogenic",
      "MR_bounds": [4.5, 6.5],
      "Pc_bar_bounds": [10, 300],
      "eps_bounds": [5, 200],
      "notes": [
        "Highest Isp class; very low density LH2; large tanks",
        "Many engines run MR ~5.5–6.0 for cooling/cycle reasons"
      ],
      "datasets": {
        "equilibrium": "LOX_LH2_equilibrium.json",

}
```
