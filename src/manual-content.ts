    body: `<h3>Begin with a small hop</h3><p>Adjust the <b>Propellant load</b> and <b>Launch angle</b>, then use <b>Lift off</b>. The fuel strip in <b>Flight measurements</b> shows what remains and when the engine stops. Coasting means the rocket is still moving with the engine off.</p>
    <h3>Open the workshop</h3><p><b>Engine estimates</b> previews the starting performance. <b>Engine & vehicle workshop</b> contains the propellant choice, empty mass, chamber pressure, throat diameter, expansion ratio, mixture ratio and efficiencies. Estimates describe the model; they are not a promise about a real vehicle.</p>
    <h3>Choose how it steers</h3><p>In <b>Guidance</b>, <b>Hold launch angle</b> keeps the original direction. <b>Timed pitch</b> turns towards a chosen angle over a chosen interval. <b>Follow velocity</b> points along the direction of travel once the selected speed is reached.</p>
    <h3>Get back to a reliable starting point</h3><p><b>Reset rocket settings</b> restores the propellant, load, angle, engine, vehicle and guidance controls together. It stops the current flight and keeps your world and cannon settings. The starting rocket can lift off from all planetary presets, including Venus and Jupiter; the Sun’s gravity still defeats it. The <b>Reset</b> beside Lift off clears the flight while keeping your own design.</p>

    <h3>Before a rocket launch</h3><p><b>Engine estimates</b> updates as you adjust the setup. Watch the app’s lift-off warning: the rocket needs enough upward thrust to overcome its weight. Use the rocket lesson to understand what each engine setting changes.</p>
    <h3>Keep the model in mind</h3><p>Launch Lab uses simplified physics. The flight model leaves out air drag and wind, even on worlds with atmospheres. The artwork, visitors and imaginary launch sites are there for enjoyment; they are not scale drawings.</p>

    <p>It is a place to follow a question, try a small experiment and see something unexpected. The physics invites a closer look; the characters occasionally have other ideas.</p>
    <p>The hope is simply that it makes room for a little curiosity, whether you are learning on your own, sharing a tablet or exploring together in a classroom.</p>
